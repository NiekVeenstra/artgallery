          <p>Synaptic Entropy Creations is an artist based in the Netherlands.</p>
          <p>
            I create work based on images that come to mind from past memories about adventures or
            other experiences in my life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Feel free to look, criticize or adore my work it's up to every individual on its own.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have decided to create NFT's because I am a big fan of the crypto space and I believe
            it to be the future. I will also never re-create my artwork so the ammounts of NFT's
            minted at the start will always be the maximum.
